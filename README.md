### LLM Demos

A place to explore some work with LLMs.

Start with [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_pres_county.csv).

The site worked pretty well as is, it did a good job at having working drop down menus and it even allowed you to switch from statewide results to county result. It even included colors based on party which was good. 

Improving the link did not help at all, at first I wanted to make it more interactive and have more maps and charts but those did not work. They charts did not pop up when clicking on the different features that were on the dropdown menu. I even then went back and asked it to add a button that shows democrats and republicans votes and to fix the javascript and it attempted but I ran out of free messages with Claude.  

I would definitely use this type of website design in a journalistic way when dealing with any census data, this would be a good way to show differences between counties with general population questions. I would aslo use this website style when trying to compare my favorite sports team comparison to other teams during the season, this would be a good interactive way to show the differences.
